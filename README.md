# climate-infographic

## Description

This is an infographic, and it is the first project I created after learning basic HTML and CSS. I designed and developed it myself, thoroughly enjoying the process. Through this project, I discovered my strong interest in both design and coding. I chose the topic of climate change because it is a significant issue today, and I wanted to raise awareness about its impact.

## Technology
